\usage{
markersListOverlap(
  markerList1,
  markerList2,
  genes1,
  genes2 = NULL,
  logFCThr = 0,
  pct1Thr = 0,
  colStr = "avg_log2FC",

}
\arguments{
\item{markerList1}{List of marker data frames.}

\item{markerList2}{List of marker data frames.}

\item{genes1}{Genes in the first dataset.}

\item{genes2}{Genes in the second dataset. If \code{NULL} (as default), no
second dataset will be used.}

\item{logFCThr}{Value of average log2 fold-change above which markers will
be retained.}

\item{pct1Thr}{Value of fraction of cells expressing the marker above which
markers will be retained.}

\item{colStr}{Numeric column.}

\item{isHighTop}{Whether higher values in the numeric column correspond to
top markers.}

\item{extraCutoff}{Cutoff to be placed at one end of the cutoff list.
If \code{isHighTop} is \code{TRUE}, it must be lower than all the cutoffs
present in the marker list, and if \code{isHighTop} is \code{FALSE}, it must
be higher that all cutoffs present in the marker list.}

\item{maxNCutoffs}{Maximum number of cutoffs. If the two input data frames
contain more cutoffs than this value, only \code{maxNCutoffs} linearly
spaced cutoffs will be selected from the original cutoff list.}

\item{pvalThr}{p-value threshold to be used by the Bonferroni correction.}

\item{verbose}{Whether the output should be verbose.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
