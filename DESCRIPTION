Title: A tool for performing comprehensive overlap assessments
    on lists comprising sets of strings, such as lists of gene sets. It can 
    assess overlaps of pair of sets of strings selected from the same
    universe or from different universes, and overlaps of triplets of
    sets of strings selected from the same universe. Designed 
    for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis applications but well-suited 
    for other purposes as well.
